	<h4>ingredients</h4>
	<ul>
		
		<li>
		2 roma tomatoes (1 for slicing &amp; 1 for the sauce)
		</li>
		
		<li>
		½ yellow zucchini
		</li>
		
		<li>
		½ green zucchini
		</li>
		
		<li>
		½ aubergine (japanese aubergines are best!)
		</li>
		
		<li>
		110 g sweet mini peppers (yellow &amp; red)
		</li>
		
		<li>
		½ onion (roughly chopped)
		</li>
		
		<li>
		1.5 garlic cloves (minced)
		</li>
		
		<li>
		salt &amp; pepper for seasoning
		</li>
		
		<li>
		large sprig of thyme (stalks removed)
		</li>
		
		<li>
		2 tbsp olive oil
		</li>
		
	</ul>

	<h4>instructions</h4>
	<ul>
		
		<li>
		slice a cross in the top of each tomato, place into a pan of boiling water &amp; blanch for 30 seconds. remove immediately &amp; place in ice cold water. once cooled, peel off skins
		</li>
		
		<li>
		to make sauce, state by placing the sweet peppers into a roasting tray, season with some salt &amp; coat in olive oil. roast for 20 mins at 390˚F until starting to blister. remove from the oven &amp; leave to cool. once cooled, remove the stalks &amp; scrape out the seeds
		</li>
		
		<li>
		heat some olive oil over a medium/high hear in a new pan &amp; sauté the onions &amp; garlic until translucent (5-10 mins)
		</li>
		
		<li>
		cut the aubergine, tomato &amp; zucchinis into 2 mm / 1/8-inch thin slices (using a mandolin or knife)
		</li>
		
		<li>
		in a blender, add the sautéed onions &amp; garlic, roasted peppers, 1 of the peeled tomatoes, thyme &amp; some salt &amp; pepper to taste. blend until smooth
		</li>
		
		<li>
		cover the bottom of a circular pan in some of the sauce &amp; then later the slices of vegetables over the top in order aubergine, tomato, yellow zucchini, green zucchini. once layered, cover in a generous pinch of salt &amp; a good glug of olive oil
		</li>
		
		<li>
		lightly cover with parchment paper &amp; place in an oven of 320˚F for 40 mins. remove the parchment paper &amp; cook for a further 10 mins until ready to serve. this will leave the vegetables with a slight bite &amp; helps hold the shape when plating up. if softer vegetables are preferred, cook for an initial 1 hour instead of 40 mins, followed by 10 mins uncovered
		</li>
		
		<li>
		serve with the extra sauce &amp; a sprinkle of parsley! (can also be served with rice)
		</li>
		
	</ul>


	<h4>notes</h4>
	<ul>
		
		<li>
		if you don&rsquo;t have enough tomatoes for the sauce, tomato paste (diluted with some vegetable broth or water) can be a good substitute
		</li>
		
		<li>
		if you don&rsquo;t have sweet mini peppers, normal peppers can also be used for this recipe
		</li>
		
		<li>
		ii have found that having the sauce coat up to ¾ of the pan when vegetables are set in circles is best. traditionally, ratatouille originated from the working class as a pot stew made from leftovers, so the broth is very important to the recipe!
		</li>
		
	</ul>

	<p>		cooking this dish was one of my first experiences experimenting with different cuisines &amp; styles of cooking, inspired by the disney movie <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ratatouille<!-- raw HTML omitted -->! i definitely got much better at the recipe every time i made it, with the most recent one being my best yet! so time definitely helps with the process. this is your sign to make that one dish you’ve been craving :) </p>
