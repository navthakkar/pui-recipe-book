 - "entrée"

ingredients:
 - "2 roma tomatoes (1 for slicing & 1 for the sauce)"
 - "½ yellow zucchini"
 - "½ green zucchini"
 - "½ aubergine (japanese aubergines are best!)"
 - "110 g sweet mini peppers (yellow & red)"
 - "½ onion (roughly chopped)"
 - "1.5 garlic cloves (minced)"
 - "salt & pepper for seasoning"
 - "large sprig of thyme (stalks removed)"
 - "2 tbsp olive oil"

instructions:
 - "slice a cross in the top of each tomato, place into a pan of boiling water & blanch for 30 seconds. remove immediately & place in ice cold water. once cooled, peel off skins"
 - "to make sauce, state by placing the sweet peppers into a roasting tray, season with some salt & coat in olive oil. roast for 20 mins at 390˚F until starting to blister. remove from the oven & leave to cool. once cooled, remove the stalks & scrape out the seeds"
 - "heat some olive oil over a medium/high hear in a new pan & sauté the onions & garlic until translucent (5-10 mins)"
 - "cut the aubergine, tomato & zucchinis into 2 mm / 1/8-inch thin slices (using a mandolin or knife)"
 - "in a blender, add the sautéed onions & garlic, roasted peppers, 1 of the peeled tomatoes, thyme & some salt & pepper to taste. blend until smooth"
 - "cover the bottom of a circular pan in some of the sauce & then later the slices of vegetables over the top in order aubergine, tomato, yellow zucchini, green zucchini. once layered, cover in a generous pinch of salt & a good glug of olive oil"
 - "lightly cover with parchment paper & place in an oven of 320˚F for 40 mins. remove the parchment paper & cook for a further 10 mins until ready to serve. this will leave the vegetables with a slight bite & helps hold the shape when plating up. if softer vegetables are preferred, cook for an initial 1 hour instead of 40 mins, followed by 10 mins uncovered"
 - "serve with the extra sauce & a sprinkle of parsley! (can also be served with rice)"
 
notes:
 - "if you don't have enough tomatoes for the sauce, tomato paste (diluted with some vegetable broth or water) can be a good substitute"
 - "if you don't have sweet mini peppers, normal peppers can also be used for this recipe"
 - "ii have found that having the sauce coat up to ¾ of the pan when vegetables are set in circles is best. traditionally, ratatouille originated from the working class as a pot stew made from leftovers, so the broth is very important to the recipe!"
